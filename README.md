Features

The Custom Window Control Buttons extension enhances the standard window controls (close, minimize, maximize/restore) with the following additional features:

    Custom Buttons: This extension adds extra buttons to the window's title bar, which you can customize to perform specific actions of your choice.
    Improved Productivity: Easily access common tasks directly from the title bar without the need to navigate through menus.
    Intuitive Interface: The added buttons are designed to blend seamlessly with the existing window controls, maintaining a familiar user experience.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, you'll notice additional buttons on the title bar of your browser's windows. These buttons are configurable and can be assigned various actions according to your preferences.

By default, the extension provides the standard close, minimize, and maximize buttons. However, you can customize these buttons to perform tasks such as:

    Refreshing the current page
    Opening a new tab
    Activating a specific extension
    Running custom scripts

## Customization

Customizing the extension buttons is straightforward:

    Click on the extension's icon in the browser toolbar.
    A settings panel will open, allowing you to manage your custom buttons.
    For each button, you can set its label, icon, and the action it should perform.
    Actions can include predefined actions (e.g., reload, open new tab) or custom JavaScript code.

Remember to save your changes, and the buttons will be updated accordingly.
